There are many trends worth noting after streamlining the PyCitySchools dataset. 

I took interest in looking through some of the factors that would contribute to the schools overall passing rate. 

The top 5 preforming schools were all charter schools, while the bottom 5 preforming schools registered as District schools. Overall, Charter schools were better performers than District schools. Interestingly enough, there is not a drastic difference in funding between the different types of schools.  The Charter schools per student budget was relatively equivalent (if not less) than District schools.That said, the budget per student was not an influencing factor. If it is not the budget, what other resource could make charter schools better performers? Of the reported schools, none of the Charter schools schooled more than 2,300 students - whereas, District schools schooled anywhere from 2,700-5,000 students. It's easy to hypothesize that with a large student body as big as 2,700, the teacher to student ratio may be a factor for a lower overall passing rate. School size appears to contribute to the overall passing rate of students.
